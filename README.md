# VoiceBench

### A Low-Latency Event-Driven Voice AI Platform for Adaptive Topic-Focused Oral Assessment

> A research-oriented voice AI platform that simulates real-time oral assessments through natural voice conversations. VoiceBench combines streaming speech recognition, adaptive questioning, conversational memory, and automated evaluation to create a low-latency interview experience across any learning domain—from computer science to science, aptitude, languages, and general knowledge.

VoiceBench is an event-driven voice AI assessment platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional text-based AI systems and real-time spoken interactions. Instead of relying on typed responses, the platform conducts adaptive voice conversations that continuously evaluate a learner's understanding while dynamically adjusting question difficulty.

The system employs a streaming architecture consisting of Speech-to-Text (STT), a conversational orchestration engine, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis to minimize interaction latency and create a natural interview experience. Every interview session is automatically evaluated, scored, and archived, enabling detailed performance analytics and longitudinal learning assessment.
